## Cyber Training
### General User Training
IT has enabled the Department of Defense to transmit, communicate, collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of information. Increasing dependence on information systems has focused attention on the need to ensure that these assets, and the information they process, are protected from actions that would jeopardize the DoD's ability to effectively function. Responsibility for securing the information and systems lies within the Agency/Command components. The trained and aware user is the first and most vital line of defense.

Cyber training must be current, engaging, and relevant to the target audience to enhance its effectiveness. Its primary purpose is to educate and influence behavior. The focus must be on education and awareness of threats and vulnerabilities so users to not perform actions that lead to or enable exploitations of the Agency/Department's information systems. Authorized users must understand that they are a critical link in their organization's overall Information Assurance success.

DISA's [DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge](https://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge/launchpage.htm) is the DoD baseline standard. It meets all DoD level requirements for end user awareness training. DISA will ensure it provides distributive awareness content to address evolving requirements promulgated by Congress, the OMB under the ISS LoB for Tier I, or the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

The Agency/DoD components are required to use the DoD SCC as their Cyber Awareness Provider. The DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge will be used to meet the initial and annual training mandated by DoD regulations.

To ensure understanding of the critical importance of Cyber, all individuals with access to DoD IT systems are required to receive and complete initial Cyber awareness training before being granted access to the system(s) and annual Cyber awareness training to retain access.

All training is tracked at the Command level.

### Privileged User Training
A privileged user is a user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to have elevated rights to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. A number of high profile security incidents over the last year have proven, yet again, that privileged users -- administrators, contractors, and others with system-level access to IT infrastructure -- are a critical element of the organzation's overall risk profile.

In addition to signing a Privileged Access Agreement prior to account creation, individuals will take the [Privileged User Training](http://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/DS-IA112.html) created by DISA.

All training is tracked at the Command level.

### Role-Based Training
DISA has gathered inputs from the USCYBERCOM, [National Initiative for Cyberspace Education \(NICE\)](http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/framework/) and other partners to provide a catalog of training resources that are categorized by cyber work roles. The work roles used on this site were taken from [USCYBERCOM's Joint Cyberspace Training & Certification Standard \(JCT&CS\) v1.2](https://disa.deps.mil/ext/cop/iase/specialty_courses/Documents/20120207-B_Signed_JCTandCS.pdf). As the cyber work role process matures it will be integrated into future policy and doctrine to better recruit, train, promote and retain a superior cyberspace workforce.

While the cyber work roles may correlate to military specialities and civilian occupational classifications, they are not intended to be synonymous with discrete job positions. Each work role is listed with the associated tasks that an individual may be expected to perform the requisite skill sets needed to perform the work role tasks as related to conducting missions that span the three Lines of Operations (LOO): DoD, DGO, DCO, and OCO. As noted below in the diagram a cyberspace professional needs to fill both a supporting and operational warfighting role when operating in the Joint Information Environment (JIE).

The cyber role tasks and skill associated sets establish a proficiency baseline for a workforce capable of integrating, sychronizing, and executing sustained cyber space operations designed to achieve strategic, operational and tactical objectives. Future cyber training assessments will ensure development of necessary knowledge and skills required for increased competency in accomplishing DoD individual, staff and collective tasks.

## Physical Security Training

### Applicable Security Controls
The following physical security controls have been documented as required training:

| Number | Control | Control Text | Training Resource |
|:------:|:--------|:-------------|:------------------|
|PE-1|Physical and Environmental Protection Policy and Procedures|This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PE family. Polciy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.|[Introduction to Physical Security](http://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/PY011.html)|
|PE-2|Physical Access and Authorizations|This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization credentials include, for example, badges, identification cards, and smart cards.|*[Physical Security Planning and Implementation](http://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/PY106.html)<br/>*[Implementing Effective Physical Security Countermeasures](http://www.cdse.edu/catalog/webinars/physical-security/physical-security-countermeasures.html)|
|PE-3|Physical Access Control|This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers.|[Lock and Key Systems](http://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/PY104.html)|
|PE-6|Monitoring Physical Access|Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of and responses to detected physical security incidents. Security incidents include, for example, apparent security violations or suspicious physical access activities.|[Physical Security Measures](http://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/PY103.html)|

### Personnel and Roles
The following roles have been identified as requiring physical security training:
* Security Manager
* Physical Security Manager
* Base Security



## Malicious Code Training
A well-maintained workforce provides another organizational safeguard that can
be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect the organization
against malicious code via email or web applications. Personnel are trained to
look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an
unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving
an email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor
or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious
email or web communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking
on embedded web links, and checking the source of email addresses). For this
process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and made
aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how
to recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can
potentially provide early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition
of such anomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement automated
malicious code detection and protection tools and systems employed by the
organization.

DISA's [DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge](http://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge/launchpage.htm) contains the modules that meed the DoD requirement for malicious code training.
